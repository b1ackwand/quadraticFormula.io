# Day 1 â€“ Swift: Variables & Math Operations ðŸ§®

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- `var` is used to declare a variable (a value that can change).
- You can store multiple variables on one line.
- Swift supports real mathematical operations like square roots and order of operations.

### ðŸ§  Exercise
Using the **Quadratic Formula**, we solve:

axÂ² + bx + c = 0

With:
a = 2.0
b = 5.0
c = 3.0


We calculate two roots using:

root = (-b Â± âˆš(bÂ² - 4ac)) / (2a)

Output

Root 1 is -1.0
Root 2 is -1.5
